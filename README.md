# The Language


Drunner uses .txt files. They are like plain text, but DRunner actually processes instructions from these files.


#### Example 

```
WAIT 5
SEND Hello, world!
SHELL echo "This is a shell command"
MULT 3, 7
DIV 15, 3
ADD 10, 20
```

You just make an .txt file in the same directory as your DRunner executables.
